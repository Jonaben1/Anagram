An Anagram checker created using Python. After searching to no avail
for something similar online. I decided to create one.

Many resources I came across only compared two given words to check if they are anagram.
I don't have time for such. As a lazy programmer, I want Python to do the heavy lifiting for me. 

All I want is to type the word and Python generates the anagram.

That's exactly what this app is. 

Just type in the word, and Python will check if the word is an anagram.
If the word is not an anagram, python will only return the same word you sent

I'm open to suggestions, feel free to contact me for modifications.

Have a go at it and enjoy.
